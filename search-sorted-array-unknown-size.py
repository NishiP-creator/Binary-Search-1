https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-sorted-array-of-unknown-size/description/

Sorted array of unknown size. You don't know the length of the array. Brute force is linear probe but the length of array can be too large.
Exponential Search --> optimal search. Find the boundaries.

Edge case:
1. element not present
2. 1 element

Time Complexity: O(2logp) = O(logp)
Space Complexity: O(1)
